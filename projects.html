        <h2>Capstone Project - Small Scale Winery Inventory Manager</h2>
        <p>As of the time I'm writing this, I'm graduating college in 2 weeks! So, me and my three teammates are currently putting the finishing touches on our 3-month software development project for our computer science capstone. In it, we worked with a local winery to produce an inventory management tool that can be used to help monitor wine sales. It can be used to see recent sales, average annual sales, and an estimate of how long remaining inventory will last.</p>
        <p>Note: While the program is currently hosted online, a majority of the pages are inaccessible to new users without the client's explicit approval. So, below is the final presentation we gave for it, including a few video clips to show off what we've made using some dummy data. :)</p>

        <p>I primarily worked on the inventory upload portion of the website. It was a bit of a struggle -- mostly because of weirdness with Django. The formsets used to prompt for wine information, while incredibly versatile once you know how to use them, are a bit of a nightmare to learn for the first time since information surrounding them is a bit scarce. Unexpectedly, autofilling the fields was pretty complicated as well. Sending data from the Wine model to the frontend is unfortunately not as simple as calling some Django function. The data had to be serialized to JSON, then deserialized on the JavaScript end (which initially caused a lot of string escape issues). And THEN it still had to be matched with the selected wine's internal ID. You can imagine such an undertaking is quite daunting for someone who had never written anything in JavaScript at the time! But, I feel the final result is quite user-friendly (and, hopefully some of the stuff on this portfolio shows that it helped me become a lot more comfortable with the language)! :)</p>
        <p>I also worked a decent amount on the initial database design and the search function on the inventory view. Nothing quite as involved as the CSV part, but important components nonetheless.</p>
        <h2>Game Engine Experiments</h2>
        <p>I, like many computer science enthusiasts, am a big fan of video games! Naturally, this has led me to mess around with a few game engines. Here are some examples of my little experiments:</p>
        <div class="columns">
            <div>
                <h3>Unity</h3>
                <p>Unity is a high-level game engine that offers tons of features to help ease the game development process, using C# as its scripting language. While I've never made a fully-fledged game using it, I have played around with it a fair bit, both for standalone projects and for other platforms. As an example of the latter, VRChat requires the use of Unity to set up player models, and I made one of those. Have a look behind the scenes:</p>
                <div>
                    <img src="/images/unity_vrc-bones.png">
                </div>
                <p>So many bones...</p>
                <video width="640" height="480" autoplay loop muted>
                    <source src="/videos/unity_vrc-demo.webm" type="video/webm" />
                </video>
                <p>...But they all have a purpose!</p>
                <p>Other than the model, I've also made a simple game of Hearts. I have unfortunately misplaced the file, so I can't include any clips for now. At any rate, it was a simple project, but it was functional! It helped familiarize me with the engine before tackling things like the model above.</p>
                <p>I've also toyed around with 3D rendering and shaders. But my experience there is probably better shown in Monogame, which uses the same programming languages.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Monogame</h3>
                <p>Also using C#, Monogame is really more of a framework than an engine. Unlike Unity, it doesn't offer a lot in the way of physics components, 3D renderers, and the like -- all of that has to be programmed manually. So, most of my experiments here have revolved around learning what makes those kinds of components work. Here's an demo of a 3D renderer I made that accepts keyboard input, along with a shader written in HLSL:</p>

                </video>
                <p>You can feel every polygon and pixel--very PS1 esque.</p>

                <p>A snippet of the C# code.</p>

                <p>A snippet of the HLSL code.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Roblox</h3>
                <p>Roblox is how I got my start with programming. It's a good way to learn the basics of network programming, database management, UI design, and pretty much anything else using a simple, easy-to-learn model. The programming language, Lua, is also quite intuitive for beginners. While I haven't touched it for some time now, I've created quite a few little experiments over the years. Here are a few examples:</p>
                <video width="640" height="480" autoplay loop muted>
                    <source src="/videos/roblox_sugar-rush.webm" type="video/webm" />
                </video>
                <p>Probably the most ambitious. Has lobby minigames and an intro cutscene.</p>
                <video width="640" height="480" autoplay loop muted>
                    <source src="/videos/roblox_tennis.webm" type="video/webm" />
                </video>
                <p>The trajectory, power, and spin of the ball all affect physics simulation.</p>
                <video width="640" height="480" autoplay loop muted>
                    <source src="/videos/roblox_casino.webm" type="video/webm" />
                </video>
                <p>This one's my oldest--7 years. It's buggy, but cool to see where it all started.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Most of my experiments in these engines don't amount to a whole lot. Usually, I'm just seeing what I can do, and at most, I may produce only part of a game during what little time I have to work on it. But, over so many mini projects, I know how things work pretty well at this point.</p>
        <h2>Video Game Mods</h2>
        <p>Even with games like Minecraft or the Sims where possibilities are seemingly endless, there's often that lingering feeling of "what could've been." A lot of times, that sinking feeling quickly devolves into me modding the game to make my random thoughts into reality. Below are a few examples of things I've made:</p>
        <div class="columns">
            <div>
                <h3>Celeste</h3>
                <p>Not to brag, but I'm pretty good at Celeste (highly recommend it to any of those who are interested). The modding scene has thousands of user-made levels that teach movement tech at a wide range of difficulties, play around with the mechanics, or add entirely new ones. In particular, I'm a huge fan of <a href="https://youtu.be/55m5NN1v3W8?si=_9hzEZJNONnkNU7t">speed tech</a> (not my level, but a good example). Unfortunately for me, a lot of the vanilla mechanics don't conserve momentum, so it's a bit difficult to design fast gameplay without it becoming monotonous. To fix this egregious oversight, I fired up Visual Studio and C Sharped a few versions which <i>do</i> conserve it:</p>
                <video width="640" height="480" autoplay loop muted>
                    <source src="/videos/celeste_momentum-demo.webm" type="video/webm" />
                </video>
                <p>Here are a couple of the components I added. The arrow redirects the player's speed, while the bumpers reflect it.</p>
                <video width="640" height="480" autoplay loop muted>
                    <source src="/videos/celeste_momentum-level.webm" type="video/webm" />
                </video>
                <p>Here's how they might be used, courtesy of a custom level I made. It gets pretty wild, even while holding Theo.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Minecraft</h3>
                <p>When I was in 6th grade, I found a YouTube tutorial online to make your own mod for Minecraft 1.6.4. So, I downloaded Eclipse, learned a bit of Java, and managed to get a small Terraria-esque mod running that added copper, its tools and armor, and blinkroots (odd final choice, but I digress). I can't seem to find it anymore, but if I do, I'll try to get it up and running again.</p>
                <p>I've recently revisited this interest, and <a href="https://github.com/Maelstrom16/Railway6">made some progress toward porting a mod I like</a> to a new version. While it still doesn't quite launch yet, resolving 1800+ errors has allowed it to finally compile!</p>
                <p>And, I have some plans for my own mod now. Perhaps something to work on after I finish up here. ;)</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Creating mods for existing games is a unique challenge. You have to build a sufficiently deep understanding of how the game works, not only so that you can understand what's already there, but also so you can build upon it without completely breaking everything. It's a mess of hooks, injections, and mixins. But, once you do get something up and running, it's super cool to see your creation ingame.</p>
        <h2>Other Projects</h2>
        <p>Aside from what I've already mentioned, I also have a little <a href="https://github.com/Maelstrom16/Hydra">Game Boy emulator</a> I work on when I have time. It's not super far along, but it's able to read .gb files and interpret the information from the cartridge header.</p>
